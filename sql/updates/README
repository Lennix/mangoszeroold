NOTE: This is file special addition for mangoszero fork (from mangos 0.12)
      It describe work with backported sql updates

== Database Updates ==

This folder contains SQL files which will apply required updates to your MySQL
database, whenever the MaNGOS database structure has been changed or extended.

To see if you need an update, the file names have been given a fixed structure
that should enable you to see if you need an update or not.

=== File Name Description ===

File names are divided into two parts.

First part is the order_number, revision and counter that shows the commit revision that
will be compatible with the database after apply that particular update.
Counter sets the order to apply sql updates for the same revision. Order_number set
global order in directory for backported sql updates (its backported in random order
and need special mangoszero side order for apply).

The second part of the name is the database and the table that needs an update or has been added.

See an example below:

         z0001_xxx_01_characters_character_db_version.sql
         |     |   |  |          |
         |     |   |  |          |
         |     |   |  |          The table `character_db_version`
         |     |   |  |          will need an update.
         |     |   |  |
         |     |   |  Name of affected DB (default recommended name)
         |     |   |  Can be: characters, mangos, realmd
         |     |   |
         |     |   Counter show number of sql update in 0.12 backported or own (non bakported, xxx) updates list for provided master revision
         |     |   and set proper order for sql updates for same revision
         |     |
         |     MaNGOS 0.12 commit revision related to sql update (if this backported sql update.
         |     It can be absent (and replaced by xxx) if sql update not really backported but only mangoszero specific.
         |
         Order_number set special order for apply sql updates from different backported revisions in mangoszero


After applying an update the DB is compatible with the mangos revision of this sql update.
SQL updates include special protection against multiple and wrong order of update application.

Attempts to apply sql updates to an older DB without previous SQL updates in list for the database
or to DB with already applied this or later SQL update will generate an error and not be applied.

=== For Commiters ====

Possible use simplifed steps if backported revision include sql update in form that can be re-apply without problem mutiply times
then:

1. Rename sql update from 0.12 form (001_6939_01_mangos_quest_template.sql) to mangoszero form (z0001_001_01_mangos_quest_template.sql)
   using next free order_number in sql/updates files list.
2. Drop sql order guards from sql update file
3. Restore field name in db version table in db sql file (mangos.sql/etc) to state before related revision backporting.
3. Restore field name in src/shared/revision_sql.h file to state before related revision backporting.
4. Fix/update sql update file name in slq/updates/Makefile.am

If revison modify table structure and include sql update that can't be applied to db multiply times
then:

1. Rename sql update from 0.12 form (001_6939_01_mangos_quest_template.sql) to mangoszero form (z0001_001_01_mangos_quest_template.sql)
   using next free order_number in sql/updates files list.

   If this realmd sql update preserve existed mangos master sql guards, and do next step with this goal.

2. Replace sql order guards from sql update file
   (ALTER TABLE db_version CHANGE COLUMN required_029_7393_01_mangos_game_event required_035_7855_01_mangos_pools bit;)
   to mangozzero form.
2.1: Look at current guard field name in affected DB (sql/mangos.sql) and replace first (old) name (`required_029_7393_01_mangos_game_event`)
2.2: Create new field name base at mangoszero sql update name (`required_z001_029_01_mangos_game_event`)
2.3: Form final mangoszero guard query
     (ALTER TABLE db_version CHANGE COLUMN required_z001_029_01_mangos_game_event required_z0002_035_01_mangos_pools bit;)
2.4: Update field name in db version table (db_version in mangos.sql in our case) to new field name (required_z0002_035_01_mangos_pools)
2.5: Update field name in affected DB related define (REVISION_DB_MANGOS) in src/shared/revision_sql.h
     to new field name (required_z0002_035_01_mangos_pools)
3. Fix/update sql update file name in slq/updates/Makefile.am
